title: Where to find peace?
---

Peace, the magic word, more valuable than happiness, elusive. We all search for it, all our lives, some find it, some don't. The question remains, where do you find peace? How do you find peace? If you have everything in the world, will that be peaceful? Will giving up everything be peaceful? Will sitting long in meditaion will be peaceful? Will holy company give you peace? I don't know, but I can tell you this, you can experience peace right here (wherever you are), right now. That may seem strange or theoretical but today I want to tell you about a small glimpse I had of this elusive thing called peace, not once, but twice.

Interestingly, both the times where in the midst on very unlikely situations, morning time, child getting ready for school, mom screaming, cooking in the kitchen, loud construction work outside. With all this going on I was sitting still as a rock, no back ache, no thinking, no worries, no emotions, tears rolling down, yet I don't care. I was aware of all things going on, yet just like sitting in a movie theatre, I was just enjoying the show, detached from all the activity around me. I was not trying to think about God, not saying _neti, neti_. I was just there, sitting there, aware. The tears were not due to some great emotion, some letting go, they just happened, and I was aware of them, and that was it, nothing special.

Long not for peace, long for God. God is peace.

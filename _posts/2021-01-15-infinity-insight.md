title: Insight on Infinity
---

I couldn't help but share this amazing insight shared by Swami Sarvapriyananda about the nature of Infinity as defined in Vedanta. It is explained in one of his Bhagavad Gita classes, when someone asked him about what exactly does Infinity mean. I am writing down just the gist of it here, and strongly suggest you to hear his words directly. It somewhere around 15 minutes before the end of lecture on [Chapter 2, Verse 11 - 12](https://soundcloud.com/vedantany/2-bhagavad-gita-chapter-2-verse-11-12-swami-sarvapriyananda?in=vedantany/sets/bhagavad-gita-swami). 

Here is my understanding.

### What is Infinity?

Infinite object is defined as an object that is not bounded. Any object can be bounded in three ways, and Inifinity is not bounded in any of these ways.

1. It should not be bounded by space. Bounded by space means that, given that the object occupies a certain space, implies that it does not occupy any other space. Thus, Infinite permeates all space.
2. It should not be bounded by time. Bounded by time, means that the object has a start and has an end. Thus, Infinity is *eternal*.
3. It should not be bounded by object. Something bounded by object means that it is something that it different from every other object in the universe. It has an identity. Infinity instead is not bounded by object and thus everything in this universe is same as it. Or everything in this universe is Infinity. Also, there can be only one Infinity, thus, everything in this universe is same, the Infinity itself.

# Life 2.0

If you read my first post and liked it, you may have expected an post after 15 days. Well, two months have passed since my last post and there are important things to share with everyone. The reason for being away for so long is that I became a father around a month back and life has changed a hell lot since then. I am learning the new ways and trying to find a balance between my old life and my new one. I am learning new things everyday. I don’t think I have the writing ability to put my feelings in words, but, it feels good, sometimes very tiring, but good. Being fully responsible for another human being is such a different feeling. Unfortunately, my kid had to be hospital for a few days after his first week, and it was such a taxing mental experience. It was so difficult watching doctors collecting blood samples from the tiny hands. Everything is back to normal now, and kid’s growth is back on track.

# Back after a break

So, finally after a three week break I started doing my daily practices again. Though I was not doing my daily morning practices, I kept doing Vajrasana after meals whenever I had time. Even now, it is difficult to get a full hour of time to do my practices so I have reduced y practice time to half an hour. I believe it is important to keep practicing everyday, so the book’s (A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of Yoga and Kriya) half and hour and 15 minutes practices have been very helpful. I had feared that, just starting out, then taking a break for 3 weeks will mean that I have to start from beginning, but it was not so. I am still able to do Ardha Titli Asana with same level of flexibility even after the break. Also, for some reason I am feeling that I am doing yogic breathing better. One important improvement is that now I can almost sit in Padmasana pose. As mentioned earlier, my right leg kind of lags behind my left leg in flexibility, so one it is in better shape I will be able to sit in Padmasana. I am hoping it will not take more than two weeks.

Having to wake up all every few hours during the night has forced me to do my practices a little late in the day. With time I will be able to settle down to a better schedule. For now, I have to keep doing my practices everyday. See you in a two weeks.
